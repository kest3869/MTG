Earth Kingdom Protectors,D+,W,uncommon,,,
Enter the Avatar State,B-,W,uncommon,What a power crept one mana trick.,,

Airbender's Reversal,C+,W,uncommon,,,
Invasion Reinforcements,B,W,uncommon,"Resolute reinforcements, but double ally. Great with waterbending, airbending, and firebending. This can go in so many decks",,
Water Tribe Rallier,C+,W,uncommon,,,
Earth Kingdom Jailer,C+,W,uncommon,O-ring effects on creatures are usually easier to remove. But a 3/3 body in the meantime is fine.,,
Fancy Footwork,C+,W,uncommon,,,
Glider Staff,C,W,uncommon,"3 mana bounce something of an opponents plus an equipment. Good for tempo, but equipment are usually bad in limited.",,
Team Avatar,D-,W,uncommon,"Ughhh the flexibility is nice, but usually these enchantments that don't otherwise affect the board state play pretty badly. Especially if this is a pretty aggro format like I suspect firebending might push it.",,
"Aang, the Last Airbender",C+,W,uncommon,"A flying Manowar, probably pretty good.",,
Destined Confrontation,C-,W,uncommon,A wrath type effect at uncommon? Maybe this is something that will tamp down on the aggro leanings firebending would push. Though in the early game this won't be removing much and your opponents get to choose. Probably a sideboard card.,,
Southern Air Temple,D-,W,uncommon,"There are no shrines at common, so I'm skeptical that a shrine deck will be that viable regularly in draft.",,
Vengeful Villagers,D+,W,uncommon,Hmm a little underwhelming for 4 mana at uncommon.,,
Gather the White Lotus,G,W,uncommon,"Monocolor payoffs? Interesting, but rarely will you be monocolor in limited, so this might be like 5 mana make 3 1/1s and scry 2. Not that good.",,
Master Piandao,C+,W,uncommon,,,
"Appa, Loyal Sky Bison",C,W,uncommon,"6 mana is a lot in limited, but the flexibility is pretty good. It's hard to not to give him extra points for being best boy tho.",,
Boomerang Basics,C+,U,uncommon,One mana bounce is a pretty big tempo play. Even though sorcery is a drawback,,
Gran-Gran,C-,U,uncommon,,,
Honest Work,C,U,uncommon,Oof don't love that this also ramps your opponent. But it is only 1 mana.,,
Accumulate Wisdom,C+,U,uncommon,,,
Benevolent River Spirit,C+,U,uncommon,"If you can get enough things down early, I like this card as long as it's 5 mana or less. But that does likely mean tapping your creatures.",,
Crashing Wave,C+,U,uncommon,2 mana three stun counters. Might be a sideboard card against aggro. Or a late game play to push through damage. Is 5 mana tap and stun three things good? It's a pretty strong tempo play.,,
Knowledge Seeker,B-,U,uncommon,So many upsides here for a two mana creature. Waterbending with it's vigilance and clue token.,,
Master Pakku,C+,U,uncommon,"The lesson mill is most likely flavor text from what I can tell so far, but a 2 mana creature with prowess isn't bad.",,
Waterbending Scroll,G,U,uncommon,"Another monocolor payoff, which usually isn't where you end up in limited. It does just sit around for waterbending until you might use this in the late game, but that's probably not what you want to do with 2 mana.",,
Invasion Submersible,C+,U,uncommon,Another Manowar! Can waterbend itself for its own ability.,,
"Katara, Bending Prodigy",B-,U,uncommon,A creature that continues to grow is pretty good. And 6 mana to draw a card as a mana sink is also not bad.,,
North Pole Patrol,C+,U,uncommon,,,
The Spirit Oasis,G,U,uncommon,"Again, I just don't think there are enough shrines to make this work in limited. This also doesn't work with waterbending either.",,
"Teo, Spirited Glider",D,U,uncommon,"Flying connive is good. 1/4 for 4 is not, though.",,
Ember Island Production,D,U,uncommon,"Welcome to flavortown, baby! But very situational.",,
Sokka's Haiku,C+,U,uncommon,"Counter spell plus draw is usually good, but holding up five mana could be tough. Gets better with instant speed mana sinks in the deck.",,
Serpent of the Pass,C+,U,uncommon,Tolarian Terror at the Earth King's home.,,
Northern Air Temple,G,B,uncommon,Just not enough shrines I think.,,
Zuko's Conviction,C+,B,uncommon,Instant speed reanimation plus flexibility and works with firebending. ,,
Epic Downfall,B,B,uncommon,Always trading up.,,
Fatal Fissure,C-,B,uncommon,"Emotional damage. A 2 mana 4/4 is good, but you have to hold up the 2 mana and hope your opponent removes your creature? A combat trick? If you have sacrifice maybe.",,
Heartless Act,B,B,uncommon,Damn even more emotional damage.,,
"Joo Dee, One of Many",C+,B,uncommon,"If you have a lot of clues sitting around, you could turn them into 2/2s I guess. Goes crazy with Soul Cauldron in Standard (though probably not a tier deck (hopefully)).",,
"June, Bounty Hunter",C-,B,uncommon,Turning creatures into clues is usually not as good.,,
Fire Nation Engineer,C,B,uncommon,,,
Fire Navy Trebuchet,C,B,uncommon,Lmao a LOTR reprint basically. You have to be attacking consistently. Good sac fodder.,,
Ozai's Cruelty,C-,B,uncommon,Lmao the artist did not have to do that. Just saw clip of Voxy reacting to it haha.,,
Ruinous Waterbending,C,B,uncommon,A more realistic aggro counterplay card perhaps. Sideboard of course.,,
Tundra Tank,D+,B,uncommon,,,
Wolfbat,C,B,uncommon,Is this bringing notes of Sneaky Snacker? Hold Kevin back.,,
"Azula, On the Hunt",B-,B,uncommon,Damn. Can be attacks you draw a card and lose a life. Or hold onto the clue for later. Pretty good.,,
Buzzard-Wasp Colony,D-,B,uncommon,4 mana 2/2. I mean this could be a Necrosquito and we all remember how unbeatable that card was.,,
"Lo and Li, Twin Tutors",G,B,uncommon,But," I'm Li...so who's banished?"" I mean if there's a busted Lesson or Noble to tutor this could be good"," but otherwise damn it's a 5 mana 2/2."""
