Name,Notes,Josh,Color
Forum Familiar,A lot of mana for some protection,D+,W
Krovod Haunch,Flavor win. Equip 2 hurts.,D+,W
Wrench,"Kor Halberd (which I thought was underated), plus more text; but equip cost 2.",D,W
Perimeter Enforcer,Great in UW,C+,W
Call a Surprise Witness,"Instead of of coming in tapped, it comes in flying for only one more mana!",C+,W
Case of the Gateway Express,Absolutely cracked for go wide aggro,B-,W
Case of the Pilfered Proof,"UW card, a bit of a build around, high ceiling.",C-,W
Neighborhood Guardian,"With disguise, probably triggerable more often, but still oof.",D,W
Not on My Watch,"Exile is good, better in control than aggro.",B-,W
Sanctuary Wall,"Good slow down for control, potential for aggro. More expensive Clockwork Drawbridge, and that stun counter hurts.",D+,W
Case File Auditor,A more specific ( and worse) Akal Pakal. But it can get you another card and start a chain if you have a lot of cases.,B-,W
Karlov Watchdog,Big for Boros aggro,C+,W
Absolving Lammasu,"Might be too slow of a response to aggro at 5 mana. Still, it's 4 power in the air.",C,W
Essence of Antiquity,Aggro be quaking in its boots,B-,W
,,,
Candlestick,"Equip 2 really hurts, but card selection is nice.",D,U
Case of the Filched Falcon,"In a clue heavy deck, this is a cheap card with a lot of upside",B,U
Curious Inquiry,"Slower Curiosity, but with a buff",D+,U
Mistway Spy,"No longer bane of the format 1/1 flyers, but still a good card.",C,U
Burden of Proof,"Flexible buff debuff is nice in UW, probably only use the debuff as a combat trick maybe, like Eaten by Pirhanas?",C+,U
Eliminate the Impossible,"A control answer to aggro, but without the Pogwork Wrestler body it struggles. Acts more like a bad fog then.",D-,U
Exit Specialist,"With all the disguise, I'm not sure how often this will be unblockable. But it does mean trades.",C+,U
Fae Flight,Casting this on a bomb could be a finisher. Good against things that need to be cast before attackers are declared.,C-,U
Forensic Researcher,Probably the cheapest collect evidence that is playable. Psuedo vigilance.,C+,U
Furtive Courier,Volatile Wanderglyph + Merfolk Cave Diver,C,U
Sudden Setback,Unlucky Drop but for an extra blue can also be a non-counter counterspell,C+,U
Surveillance Monitor,"I'm somewhat skeptical of collect evidence, but hey, creating two bodies is a prove method. Might not be able to cast this on curve...",B-,U
Living Conundrum,"I mean I guess there will be a lot of card draw in this set, but oof hot damn if this what you're relying on.",G,U
Agency Outfitter,Those are two really bad cards to tutor,D-,U
,,,
Case of the Gorgon's Kiss,"Not having flash hurts this, but if you can solve this as the trick all on the same turn, it's very good. Otherwise, having it face up allows your opponent to play around it.",B-,B
Festerleech,,C-,B
Lead Pipe,This has to be the worst one of the clue equipments.,G,B
Leering Onlooker,Good in a control deck since it can be done at instant speed.,B-,B
Long Goodbye,2 mana to get 3 mana or less isn't great; how this interacts with disguised is a big question that might help it since it specifcally calls out the ward--probably what it's designed for.,C,B
Presumed Dead,Fungal Fortitude but helps an aggro deck a lot.,C+,B
Clandestine Meddler,Menace plus card selection is pretty good.,B-,B
Slimy Dualleech,,C,B
Nightdrinker Moroii,Surprise 4 damage off of disguise is nice,B-,B
Soul Enervation,"One or more hurts this, but it's expensive removal and as a trick many times.",C-,B

Polygraph Orb,A good card advantage card in control with Zoyowa stapled onto it.,C+,B
Undercity Eliminator,If Dusk Rose Reliquary was 4 mana more but with a body.,C+,B
Persuasive Interrogators,"The one poison counter card of the deck--probably going to be really hard to kill that way with just this, but it might be a niche finisher for UB control. This is probably either cracked or stone cold unplayable.",D,B
,,,
Convenient Target,Beamtown Beatstick?,C,R
Frantic Scapegoat,Get in damage until you can give a better creature menace.,C+,R
Knife,This whole cycle is bad.,D-,R
Torch the Witness,"One of the few red removal spells that will hit most things, but it's sorcery speed and slower. Tough because Cut In was good, but Rumbling Rockslide was bad.",C,R
Concealed Weapon,Surprise 3 damage is nice.,C+,R
Expose the Culprit,This feels very situational,D-,R
Reckless Detective,Not good on curve,D,R
Vengeful Tracker,The aggro answer to clues lol,C-,R
Case of the Burning Masks,"Can probably solve this in one turn in aggro, but tough to do all that then cast a spell, especially since it would have to be instant speed.",C,R
Crime Novelist,,C,R
Harried Dronesmith,Probably has a lot of synergies,B-,R
Caught Red-Handed,"5 mana for the threaten effect sucks, but it's usually used as a finisher anyway and suspect definitely helps with that.",B-,R
Cornered Crook,"In a set with shock, these look really expensive",C,R
Bolrac-Clan Basher,"If you have a way to buff this, then dang; dies to cheap removal tho.",C,R
,,,
Get a Leg Up,Trample is better than reach.,C-,G
Hard-Hitting Question,Cheap bite spell.,C+,G
Hedge Whisperer,Fills the sameish role as Tendril but cheaper.,C,G
Rope,This might be a contender for worst clue equipment tho.,G,G
Aftermath Analyst,Oof.,D-,G
Flourishing Bloom-Kin,"Phenomenal in mono-green, but I'm not sure how good that deck will be.",D,G
Case of the Trampled Garden,,B-,G
Pompous Gadabout,Verdant Outrider but more specific.,D+,G
Sample Collector,"Good for BG, hard to repeat for very long.",D,G
Chalk Outline,Feels like a build around card--on its face it's a four mana do nothing.,D,G
Greenbelt Radical,7 mana finisher. ,B-,G
A Killer Among Us,"This card sure will be fun, but is it good? ...only attacking creatures",C-,G
Culvert Ambusher,,C-,G
Glint Weaver,"Really expensive, but helps stabilize",D+,G
,,,
No More Lies,This is a counterspell before turn 6 usually.,B-,M
Private Eye,,C+,M
Curious Cadaver,,B-,M
Coerced to Kill,,B,M
Rune-Brand Juggler,,B-,M
Deadly Complication,,C+,M
Break Out,,C,M

Soul Search,,C+,M
Wispdrinker Vampire,,B,M
Gleaming Geardrake,,B-,M
Detective's Satchel,,C-,M
Insidious Roots,One ore more hurts here. It doesn't seem like there are that man creature tokens to take advantage of this either,D,M
Kraul Whipcracker,"It feels like this will usually just be destroying a clue, which may be good but doesn't seem like that much.",C,M
Lightning Helix,Fewer decks but very nice.,B,M
Meddling Youths,A+ flavor.,C+,M
Evidence Examiner,Probably don't even want to collect evidence with this ability as it will limit the ones that actually do things,C-,M
Repulsive Mutation,Simic counterspell??,B-,M
Push // Pull,Sorcery speed really hurts push.,C+,M
Hustle // Bustle,"Removal for smaller creatures I guess, finisher on the other end is quite good if your board state is good",C,M
Cease // Desist,"I really can't see using this for anything but the channel--the ""wrath"" is expensive and narrow.",C-,M
Fuss // Bother,Evaluating these dual cards is tough.,C,M
Flotsam // Jetsam,Good for collect evidence.,C+,M
,,,
Case of the Shattered Pact,"Bad fixing if not in five colors, great with five colors. Hydrib symbols might get this over the line in some decks; probably shouldn't play unless it can be solved.",D+,C
Lumbering Laundry,A+ flavor text.,D,C
Magnetic Snuffler,All of the equipment seems pretty bad,D,C
Branch of Vitu-Ghazi,"Flexible land/creature slot as a fake out, minor flood insurance",C+,L
Scene of the Crime,Worse than the common one,D-,L
