Name,Notes,Nate,Color
Forum Familiar,"It's just a 1 mana 1/1 no text with some flexibility. This will be the Mischevious Pup of this format, underwhelming but okay in a pinch",C-,W
Krovod Haunch,"Not a fan of this at 1 mana, but at 3 mana this could be interesting. Still gonna take some convincing on this one",D+,W
Wrench,"Giving vig is nice, I guess... the tap ability and equip cost is just too slow for this to be good",D,W
Perimeter Enforcer,"In the detective deck, I like this and it could be really annoying- otherwise, it's no Bat.",C+,W
Call a Surprise Witness,I do like that this gives flying and it comes in untapped... still not super good though,C-,W
Case of the Gateway Express,"This will be bad in blocking decks, pretty good in attacking decks- I can see this being one of the key finishers for an aggresive deck",C+,W
Case of the Pilfered Proof,"Good in the right deck, unplayable outside of it",C-,W
Neighborhood Guardian,Bear with solid upside usually is solid- if you can trigger this multiple times a turn then it can get to be pretty good,C+,W
Not on My Watch,Upgraded and cheaper Kill Shot... seems good but not great,B-,W
Sanctuary Wall,"Big booty and a tapper, this should play okay for that... which is not very well",D+,W
Case File Auditor,"Cool in the right deck, otherwise this is pretty weak for 3 mana",D+,W
Karlov Watchdog,"2 toughness hurts, but if disguise is as important to this set as I think it will be these abilities will make attacky decks very happy",C+,W
Absolving Lammasu,"I like this guy quite a bit, if I'm going to play a 5 drop in modern limited it needs this much text, stats, and keywords. ",C+,W
Essence of Antiquity,"Holy 10 toughness this is gonna be annoying to punch through, 1 power is super nice, and the flip ability is great. I am a big fan, and the untap will lead to some huge blowouts because you can't respond to it- I love a defensive ambush  (hopium)",C+,W
,,,
Candlestick,Put it with the rest of the barely playable uncommon equipment- at least it's a clue later?,D+,U
Case of the Filched Falcon,"In the right deck, this will play very well. If you don't have much artifact generation, this is terrible and is 3 mana to cycle",C-,U
Curious Inquiry,"With enough fliers/evasion, this could play well. If you don't have much evasion, do not ever play this.",C-,U
Mistway Spy,"As the only 1 drop flying creature in the set, its ability only acting on turning face up is for the good of the format. Pretty mid overall",C,U
Burden of Proof,"The Eaten By Piranhas of this set- does not remove abilities, but gives some value on your creatures. My guess is it'll play similarly",C,U
Eliminate the Impossible,Oh this is gonna get people good- it's Cogwork Wrestler's ability for OP's entire team plus a Clue token for 2 mana.,C+,U
Exit Specialist,"So many good little things about this- it's a detective, the flip ability is good, being unblockable by big stuff is good. I like them.",B-,U
Fae Flight,"Green common that also gives hexproof, eat my wings! This is cheaper and just better",C-,U
Forensic Researcher,"I don't get this guy, gonna have to get beaten by it to understand its value properlyl",D+,U
Furtive Courier,"Unblockable is a good keyword, but this is only playable in one deck",D+,U
Sudden Setback,"Double blue hurts, but this acts as a counterspell AND an Unlucky Drop-type effect. I suspect it'll play decently well in most blue decks",C+,U
Surveillance Monitor,"ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS collect evidence. If you do, this is quite strong. If not, it is terrible",C+,U
Living Conundrum,Meme sidequest accepted- mill myself and win with a 10/10 flying vig hexproof. Uh... it's bad generally. Duh.,D,U
Agency Outfitter,"This is a reason to play one of each of these commons if you can find them- 6 mana 4/3 flying draw 2 free (middling) spells and cast them is not terrible. Not quite don't play bad cards to make your bad cards better, but close to it",D+,U
,,,
Case of the Gorgon's Kiss,"Very situational, and good luck flipping this.",D,B
Festerleech,I guess this is an okay one mana 1/1 to draw in the mid game? Even then I'm just not a fan in a format without too much in the way of graveyard recursion,D+,B
Lead Pipe,"Put it with the rest of the middling equipment. I do enjoy the mental image of beating someone (in game) over the head with a lead pipe, though",D+,B
Leering Onlooker,"2 mana flyer with a big booty and value once it hits the graveyard- all good, but not great, things",C+,B
Long Goodbye,"Premium removal is premium, also deals with disguised creatures full stop which is nice",B,B
Presumed Dead,Fungal Fortitude of this format at uncommon... should play about the same as usual,D+,B
Clandestine Meddler,"This is interesting for attacky decks, getting card selection and some evasion for your attacky creatures is nice but individually this is below rate so I can't give it too many points",C-,B
Slimy Dualleech,"Giving something deathtouch is nice, including itself- 4 mana 3/4 deathtouch attacking isn't too bad, and it has a fairly big booty... this might be sneaky decent",C-,B
Nightdrinker Moroii,"3+2 mana for a 4/2 flying- now that is what this card is designed to do. You don't want to play this for its regular cost, the disguise being 2 mana is nice, though it does die to Shock and all the 2/2 fliers which kinda sucks",C,B
Soul Enervation,"It's a bit slow for just -4/-4, but in the right deck that draining is going to do some work. Points for being removal with extra value stapled to it or just okay removal if needed",C,B
It Doesn't Add Up,"Instant speed and to the battlefield untapped has my attention, plus giving menace will play well in aggressive lists. Just so bad in blocky decks, though, unless you have some nice ETBs to get back",C-,B
Polygraph Orb,"This is terrible, just way too expensive to be remotely playable. If the format is really slow, I could be wrong, but I doubt it.",G,B
Undercity Eliminator,"5 mana 3/3 with bone shards stapled to it? Is that really worth 5 mana? I think not, there is just so much better removal in this format. Still is conditional removal, so not completely unplayable, just mostly unplayable",D,B
Persuasive Interrogators,"Intriguing as a 1 of that both replaces itself and can act as an alternate win con if you make a lot of clues in your deck. Secret control deck tech? On it's own it's just okay, does not win the game by itself and cannot be less than 6 mana",D+,B
,,,
Convenient Target,"I have a feeling about the aggro deck of the format... and something like this card is going to be how it ticks... could be wrong, but I think this might be sneaky good because anything can now have menace and force trades or get in ",C+,R
Frantic Scapegoat,"This is a one drop with a lot of text... this text will probably be good in aggro. Otherwise, this looks pretty weak. ",C-,R
Knife,"...It's a knife. That's it. Gives first strike and becomes a card later- best of the bunch of the bad equipments, but that isn't saying much",D+,R
Torch the Witness,"Good removal is good, red needed an X burn spell and this does the job nicely",B-,R
Concealed Weapon,This is really interesting design... that just doesn't get there for my money. Could maybe see play in aggro but I think you'd rather just give them menace,D+,R
Expose the Culprit,"This seems okay as a 1 of in some decks, getting an expensive flip cost for 2 mana and 1 card is slightly mana positive I guess... I don't think this will be very good in general",D,R
Reckless Detective,"It is a detective, which is funny- will help make the U/R deck tick, but outside of that it's only a 2 mana 2/3 if you rummage. In a deck that does not like that, it is unplayable. If the deck does, this is pretty sweet at a 2 mana 2/3 with value",C-,R
Vengeful Tracker,"Interesting choice to punish the artifact sac deck/clues in general- sideboard this will be good in like a few matchups, otherwise it's just a bear.",D+,R
Case of the Burning Masks,"Removal that eventually turns into some card advantage? In MY red deck? I like it for red, it's still a bit hard to cast with being double red though",C,R
Crime Novelist,"In the one deck that wants this, it's quite decent. Otherwise, this is unplayable",D,R
Harried Dronesmith,"I kinda like this- it just sits there, prints little fliers that get in for 1 and then trigger any value you get from sac-ing artifacts or are sac fodder for other things. I don't want a ton of these, but I could see playing 1 in the U/R shell",C-,R
Caught Red-Handed,"Instant speed is nice, but just way too expensive to be as strong as something like Twisted Fealty",D+,R
Cornered Crook,A vanilla 5/4 unless you sac an artifact to deal 3 to any target... once... not ideal but maybe an emergency playable in the U/R deck,D,R
Bolrac-Clan Basher,"Double strike and trample are a powerful combination. I like this guy as a 1-of in attacky decks, not really otherwise. I suspect you'll want to suspect this thing ASAP to give it menace, too, which just gets ugly fast",C-,R
,,,
Get a Leg Up,"Reach tricks are an important part of a balanced diet of flying creatures. Green needed this, and I don't think it will be too bad. Still a combat trick, though, so not great.",D+,G
Hard-Hitting Question,1 mana sorcery speed punch? Put it in every green deck ever in limited. This should play quite well,B,G
Hedge Whisperer,"Love the name and the art, but that's about it. Just too slow for modern limited and only works on one land at a time",D,G
Rope,"The equip cost of 3 hurts SO badly... if you can get this equipped, it's the best of the cycle. When it's inevitably too expensive, it's one of the worst.",D,G
Aftermath Analyst,...this thing cannot be for limited players... right? 2 mana 1/3 mill 3 is just not playable in limited these days,D,G
Flourishing Bloom-Kin,"Okay this is better. Rewards you for being more green, gives you extra lands in the late game, and scales as you play more and more lands. Still, having no keywords means this isn't great, and you do need a forest for this to not instantly die",C,G
Case of the Trampled Garden,"If this format is like LCI, this is it's Jade Seedstones. When it inevitably isn't, this is just too win-more for my liking the vast majority of the time",D+,G
Pompous Gadabout,"I do like hexproof (even if it's only half the time), and not being able to be blocked by diguise creatures is nice... for 3 mana, this still trades for most 2 drops, though, which is just not very good. ",D+,G
Sample Collector,"A little understatted, but it can grow itself so this might be okay in the right decks as an easy, repeatable collect evidence trigger",C-,G
Chalk Outline,"4 mana, do nothing on ETB enchantment? Gonna have to lose to this before I even consider playing it.",G,G
Greenbelt Radical,"Either this is a rate creature or a disguise creature with a smaller overrun effect? Both would be solid on their own, staple them together and you get a card I like, but don't love. Will play maybe 2 in the same deck happily",C,G
A Killer Among Us,5 mana for 3 1/1 tokens... one of which might turn into a 4/4 deathtouch only on attacking... I just don't see this being all that good.,D+,G
Culvert Ambusher,"Forcing something to block is kind of removal if you have a board stall situation, otherwise this is a little understatted but makes up for it with added flexibility. Tentative solid",C-,G
Glint Weaver,"The reason 7 mana 6/6 gain 6 was so good in BRO is that you COULD play it as a 4 mana 3/3 gain 3. This has reach, but no flexibility, which hurts it a lot.",D,G
,,,
No More Lies,"This is better mana leak. Just harder to cast. Should play decent in limited, but not too strong",C+,M
Private Eye,"A rate creature that is also a lord AND can give any detective unblockable, all in one creature. I'm a big fan of this guy, he doesn't win games on his own but still really good",B+,M
Curious Cadaver,"A little expensive, but this recursion in the right deck should be fairly easy to trigger so I think this might be okay in more controlling decks",C,M
Coerced to Kill,"Steal your biggest creature, turn it into a 1/1 deathtouch with all the abilities? A little expensive, but this is quite powerful and I like it.",B+,M
Rune-Brand Juggler,"Bear with upside that can also turn your bad suspected creatures into removal spells later in the game? That all seems pretty good, I like it but don't totally love it",B-,M
Deadly Complication,Murder that is more flexible AND you can do both. This is as premium as it gets,A-,M
Break Out,"Card draw in red green... it's fine for red green, but not that special",C+,M
Tin Street Gossip,Rate creature with vig and can act as a sol ring for your disguise creatures (which is what red green wants to do anyways)- should be very solid,C+,M
Sumala Sentry,"2 mana 1/3 reach by itself isn't too bad, plus giving +2/+2 worth of stats every time you flip a disguised creature? I'm a fan, this effect reminds me of Yotian Dissident in a good way",B-,M
Buried in the Garden,"This is going to be one of the keys to the 5 color deck, plus it's both removal and ramp. I like this a lot, even if it is a little slow",B,M
Soul Search,"Hard to cast Thoughtsieze effect, should be better than the other one of these effects but these never play super well in limited",D+,M
Wispdrinker Vampire,"This is much better- drain for one when any small creature ETBs, 4 mana 2/4 flying, plus can give a good chunk of your team deathtouch and lifelink in the lategame. Just so many ways to benefit you in this deck",B-,M
Gleaming Geardrake,I love this little guy so much- a 2 mana 1/1 flying plus a clue that grows? Yes a thousand times yes put it directly into my deck every time.,B+,M
Detective's Satchel,"It feeds itself, gives you 3 artifacts to sac, cards to draw, and thopters- not as good as the other U/R uncommon but still quite solid in this one deck (maybe splashable in some clue-heavy decks)",C+,M
Insidious Roots,This just does nothing so much of the time... gonna need some convincing on this one,D+,M
Kraul Whipcracker,"Overstatted, has reach, removes a little value or a creature token, all of these are quite good",B,M
Lightning Helix,"OOOHHHH IT'S LIGHTNING HELIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But actually, this is hard to cast but better lightning strike, it'll play good but not insane as per usual",B,M
Meddling Youths,"I like that R/W is getting some form of a value engine for attacking with 3+ creatures, and haste is not too bad, but this just seems a little weak for 5 mana unless you are the aggro deck, in which case you want maybe 1 of these",C-,M
Evidence Examiner,Bear with upside that is its own value engine later in the game... seems pretty solid for blue green.,C+,M
Repulsive Mutation,This is so strange... X +2 mana counterspell that requires a creature and just gives +1/+1 counters? I think this is fringe playable at best,D,M
Push // Pull,"Sorcery speed on the Push side hurts quite a bit, but flexibility is always good and this should play decently",C,M
Hustle // Bustle,"I like the flexible overrun style effect, also can act as pseudo-removal for 1 mana at instant speed. Solid, not great",C,M
Cease // Desist,"Front side is playable, back side is for the sideboard. I would like to avoid playing this and play better cards instead if possible",D+,M
Fuss // Bother,"Both sides are a little expensive, but both effects are solid for an attacky deck. In those decks, I think this will play decently, if not then really you only care about the backside, which hurts.",C-,M
Flotsam // Jetsam,"Alright now this plays- front side is decent in the early game, but that backside is great for the lategame too. This is definitely the best of the bunch for me.",B-,M
,,,
Case of the Shattered Pact,This is both great fixing AND a real reason to be 5 color in this format. I love it. It'll play at like a decent level and randomly be a B+ once in a great while,C,C
Lumbering Laundry,"Definition of a fine emergency playable if you need it, otherwise no thanks",D,C
Magnetic Snuffler,Do not play bad cards to make your bad cards better. That is all.,D,C
Branch of Vitu-Ghazi,I kinda like this as a fine 1-of. A creature if you need it and a land if you need it and some wierd color fixing in emergencies,D+,L
Scene of the Crime,"Springleaf drum stapled to a clue stapled to a colorless land. Seems like some fine flexibility, might be sneaky playable in small numbers",D+,L
