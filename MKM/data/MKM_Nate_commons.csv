Name,Notes,Nate,Color
Novice Inspector,This is Thraben Inspector with a relevant creature type stapled to it. It's my favorite of the common 1-drops by a good bit,B-,W
Auspicious Arrival,Bad combat trick is bad,D-,W
Marketwatch Phantom,"Bear with a relevant creature type and solid upside- watch out for this guy in the right decks, I like him quite a bit",B-,W
Seasoned Consultant,"Does not block well, maybe a decent emergency playable in R/W but I do not like this in most decks",D,W
Due Diligence,Does not draw you a card or give free spells. Normal service has resumed for these terrible enchantments,D-,W
Inside Source,"This is an interesting one... neither body having flying hurts quite a bit, but still 2 bodies and 3/3 of stats with a little upside is solid",C+,W
Make Your Move,"Bad removal gets points for being removal, definitely would prefer not to play this if I can avoid it",D+,W
Makeshift Binding,"This is white's premium removal spell at common, these usually play pretty well. 3 mana hurts a bit, but gaining 2 life is not the worst",B-,W
Griffnaut Tracker,"Graveyard hate will be relevant in this set, and I like the relevant creature type. Should be okay, but I am never happy to run more than 1 (and even the first is mid)",C-,W
Museum Nightwatch,"I don't love this, but it should play fine considering it is flexible and leaves behind a 2/2 detective. Still, 4 mana 3/2 is not good on its own.",C-,W
On the Job,"Bad mass pump effect is bad. Might play okay in the right deck, but for the most part this is only emerency playable",D,W
Haazda Vigilante,Needs other board presence (and a specific type of board presence) to be anything more than a 5 mana 4/4. Just not good in limited these days,D-,W
Defenestrated Phantom,I'm kinda interested in this as flexible topend for a white deck as a 1 of. Beyond that is pushing it unless this format is unusually slow,C-,W
,,,
Behind the Mask,"I guess this can be used either offensively or defensively, but I still hate these type of combat tricks until proven otherwise",D-,U
Bubble Smuggler,"Some points for flexibility, but a 2 mana 2/1 is just not very good and neither is a 3+6 mana 6/5 so I still just don't like this except in emergencies",D+,U
Deduce,"It being an instant helps a little, but this will probably play as well as cheap, middling cycling card does in most formats",C-,U
Jaded Analyst,"Having 2 toughness hurts so much, it still trades for the vast majority of 2 drops. I hate this thing",D,U
Reasonable Doubt,"Maybe this sounds crazy, but I kinda think that this could be okay as a 1-of in some matchups. Having some use when it isn't countering something helps a little",D+,U
Unauthorized Exit,"Instant speed bounce + some surveil value- should play fine, better if the format is more aggressive",C,U
Crimestopper Sprite,"Now this guy is where it's at for blue commons. 3 mana 2/2 flying tap something and maybe put a stun counter on it, good early and good late",B-,U
Dramatic Accusation,"This being single blue helps a ton, blue's premium removal spell at common. Still, does not deal with abilities which hurts as usual",C+,U
Projektor Inspector,"This being a 3/2 hurts a ton, it should be okay as a 1 of but I'm never happy about running this unless I have 10+ detectives",D+,U
Cold Case Cracker,"I really like this guy- hill giant with flying at single blue and on death you get a clue is all good- it won't be Oltec Cloud Guard, but it's approaching that",B-,U
Out Cold,"I am inevitably going to be salty when I lose to this, but it's bad. This effect, especially for 4 mana, is always bad in limited",D-,U
Benthic Criminologists,"Terrible outside of the one deck, where it is maybe okay as a 1 of. Middling emergency playable if needed.",D,U
Hotshot Investigators,This doesn't even have flying? This would still not be good even if it did... no thanks on this expensive creature,D-,U
,,,
Slice from the Shadows,"A little expensive, but solid removal nonetheless and especially nice in the common slot",B-,B
Snarling Gorehound,"This one drop has a lot of text on it... all of which isn't too terrible. It'll probably be fine, but nowhere near as insane as 1 drop flyers",C,B
Toxin Analysis,"I like this combat trick- deathtouch and lifelink are both really good keywords. It's still a combat trick, though, so I really only want 1 at most",D+,B
Extract a Confession,"Black's bad removal spell is still removal. In lieu of not having enough of the others, this should be fine but not great",C-,B
Repeat Offender,"2 mana 2/1 with really slow upside. I do not want to play this unless I need 2 drops badly... Emergency playable it is, then!",D,B
Unscrupulous Agent,"In a format as fast as LCI, this is a C-. With a relevant creature type and a format on average a little slower than LCI (as an intital guess), this should play decently.",C,B
Alley Assailant,"The disguise is super expensive, but flexibility is always okay and even a 3 mana 3/3 enters tapped is not the worst thing ever. Meh",C-,B
Cerebral Confiscation,"Mind rot or targeted discard... The flexibility and being 3 mana helps, but mind rot in modern limited usually doesn't play that well (if the format is slow I like this way more)",D+,B
Murder,"This is THE premium removal spell in black, maybe even in the set as a whole. Yes please.",B+,B
Macabre Reconstruction,"Sorcery speed hurts, but even still this should be okay in the right deck. Given the exiling from graveyards in this format, though, I think this will be a bit worse than normal",D+,B
Rot Farm Mortipede,"I really like this in the right deck as like a 2-of, otherwise it's better than a hill giant which helps. Still not super impressive, though",C-,B
Agency Coroner,"If this format is super grindy (unlikely), then I could see this being solid. In most formats, this is an emergency playable with a big booty.",D,B
Basilica Stalker,"Maybe this is crazy, but I like this guy. Disguise helps so much, having 4 toughness and flying is good, the upside helps, the relevant creature type. Will happily play 1, maybe 2",C,B
,,,
Felonious Rage,"This like half combat trick, half give something haste and don't block it unless you have to... not the worst thing ever, but I am not playing it until I get beat with it",D,R
Goblin Maskmaker,"Just not good enough stats, so many 2 power 2 drops in this format that most of the time this is a 1 mana 1/2 no text... no thanks",D,R
Shock,"Really solid cheap removal, as per usual- I will happily play this in multiples",B-,R
Demand Answers,"Instant speed and the sac an artifact option help, but this still likely won't play much better than usual",C-,R
Galvanize,The premium removal spell in red at common. I will play as many as I can get my grubby little hands on,B+,R
Innocent Bystander,This is usually a 2 mana 2/1 no text... very mid. Playable if you need 2 drops I guess,C-,R
Red Herring,"This being a clue is a funny design choice... other than than, this will be maybe fine in aggro decks and next to unplayable elsewhere",D+,R
Gearbane Orangutan,"HIDDEN REACH HIDDEN REACH HIDDEN REACH HIDDEN REACH HIDDEN REACH. In the right deck, 3 mana 4/4 reach is not bad. 3 mana 2/2 reach is just mid.",C,R
The Chase Is On,"Three mana combat trick? This is so embarassing, I am going to be extremely salty when I lose to this terrible, terrible card.",G,R
Person of Interest,"Two solid bodies for 4 mana, one of which has menace and the other which is a detective. Should be solid, not overly insane though",C,R
Offender at Large,"This is trying to be the Spiketail of this format, I think it'll be a little worse but still an emergency topend playable if you need it. The flexibility helps a bit, also",D+,R
Rubblebelt Braggart,"5 mana 5/5 or 5 mana 5/5 menace/can't block - you decide! I think this will be solid, but it's not very flexible and you never want more than 1.",C-,R
Suspicious Detonation,"This does get around ward, which helps- in the right deck this is really strong, otherwise it's solid but slow removal with some upside from being uncounterable",C,R
,,,
Pick Your Poison,"Sideboard playable in emergencies, otherwise nope. (sideboard)",D-,G
Rubblebelt Maverick,"This text really isn't very good. I just don't think it's enough value for me to want to put multiple of these in my deck. Lots of text on a one drop helps its case, though",D+,G
Fanatical Strength,"These effects usually play pretty well as far as combat tricks go. If I'm playing any trick I've seen so far, it's this one.",C-,G
Nervous Gardener,"I really like this one. Bear with flexibility and it fixes if you need that- flipping for one mana helps as well. Rock solid creature, nothing too special",C,G
Tunnel Tipster,"Wow, this green-only mana dork sure does exist, doesn't it? This really needed to tap for any color...",C-,G
Vitu-Ghazi Inspector,"HIDDEN REACH HIDDEN REACH HIDDEN REACH. 2 mana 2/4 reach gain 2 life is quite solid for blocking decks. 2 mana 1/3 reach isn't the worst thing ever, but is not great",C,G
Airtight Alibi,"It gives hexproof for a turn, I suppose. Other than that, this is bad and too expensive for this effect. It'll see play for the hexproof, but never happily.",D,G
Slime Against Humanity,"There is a meme deck with like 8 of these somewhere, but 3 mana 2/2 trample is just not very good in limited these days.",D,G
They Went This Way,"Slow ramp is still ramp. Gets any color, leaves a clue behind- should be playable but not happily so unless this format is very slow",D+,G
Bite Down on Crime,"I hate this card's name, as someone who has seen MTG names before. As a card, it's green's common removal spell. At 2 mana, I'm happy, at 4, significantly less so",C,G
Loxodon Eavesdropper,"This is 4+2 mana for a 4/4 with vig for a turn and draws you a card- this thing is deceptively playable, especially since you get the clue no matter what",C,G
Vengeful Creeper,"This thing needed like Reach or Trample or SOMETHING. As is, flexibility helps I guess but like this is a standard 5 mana 5/5 no text most of the time. ",D+,G
Topiary Panther,"I like this guy- getting any basic land helps so much with fixing, and a 6 mana 6/5 trample is pretty fine as a 1 of if you need it. I could see this playing decently well for a 6 mana common",C,G
,,,
Granite Witness,"4 mana 3/2 flying vig is already playable, but the flexibility adds quite a bit. Seems quite solid and is also a detective for the U/W synergies",C+,M
Faerie Snoop,"3 mana 1/4 flying is very mid unless in a blocky deck, but the flip ability drawing a card is nice. Stapled onto one card, I think this is solid also",C,M
Shady Informant,"A little expensive and the death trigger just isn't that impactful for my money. Maybe playable in some decks, but not a high pick for me",C-,M
Riftburst Hellion,"This isn't going to win any ranking contests, but this guy is going to be important for dealing with the larger flyers in this format. I have my eye on this guy as a solid 1 of in one deck",D+,M
Crowd-Control Warden,"5 mana 4/4 by itself, and it gets bigger if you are winning on board... too win-more for my taste, but could be okay in the right deck",D+,M
Sanguine Savior,"I will already play a 3 mana 2/1 flying, lifelink. Staple a 2-mana flip cost and giving something else lifelink, and yeah I like this quite a bit- also fits the BW synergies which is nice",B-,M
Gadget Technician,"Reversed Oltec Cloud Guard with extra flexibility- I am SO down for this, especially since you get the thopter on ETB as well",B-,M
Rakish Scoundrel,"Deathtouch helps this quite a bit, and while the flip ability is expensive, I do like indestructable. My guess is this will play fine",C,M
Dog Walker,"This should be pretty solid overall, 2 mana 3/1 vig is okay but the flip ability making 3 bodies is super nice for that archetype",C+,M
Undercover Crocodelf,"This wants to be like a Scream Puff so badly, but it just is not that. Flexibility helps, but no keywords hurts this a ton",D+,M
,,,
Thinking Cap,"There are like ~20 detectives at common, this actually might not be too bad",D+,C
Gravestone Strider,"Very solid fixing, blocks well, and is graveyard hate- not ideal but very playable",D+,C
Sanitation Automaton,"2 mana 2/1 survail 1 on ETB is an emergency playable in any deck, but I am never happy about running this",D,C
Magnifying Glass,"Just too slow for modern limited, and it does not fix for colors? This is just not good",D-,C
Escape Tunnel,"Better Evolving Wilds is... well... better than Evolving Wilds. Still a little slow as far as fixing goes, but the extra value is nice",C,L
Public Thoroughfare,"It is a touch slow, but I really like this fixing for any color at common (for multicolor decks, in regular decks you just never play this)",C-,L
