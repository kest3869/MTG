Name,Notes,Nate,Color
Case of the Uneaten Feast,"This looks pretty impossible to flip in most decks- if you can flip it, it's good but win more, otherwise, it's terrible- build around C+",D-,W
Assemble the Players,"A little slow for the early game, but if you do draw more than one card off of this it could provide a lot of value (hopeful grade, this may also be like a D+)",C+,W
Doorkeeper Thrull,"This is more annoying than it is good, too situational and it being symmetrical hurts a lot in limited",D+,W
Tenth District Hero,"A new take on Figure of Destiny, if you can collect evidence quickly this is insane and a 2 mana 2/3 plays great anyways",B+,W
Unyielding Gatekeeper,"Giving your opponent a 2/2 detective hurts this so much, the blink and emergency removal is cool design though.",C,W
"Delney, Streetwise Lookout","This is a commander card, in limited it will be sweet in the right deck but does nothing by itself, so it's pretty mid (build around B+)",C-,W
Wojek Investigator,"3-mana 2/4 flying, vig with upside of drawing cards or forcing your opponents to live off the top? Yes please.",A,W
Aurelia's Vindicator,"The flip ability can win games next to by itself, I see this as mainly a disguise creature but one I like a lot",A-,W
No Witnesses,"It's a 4 mana unconditional wrath. It gets an A+. An A level card, minimum.",A+,W
,,,
Lost in the Maze,"I could see this being a finisher in some decks, it looks solid but not great",B-,U
Proft's Eidetic Memory,"Commander card, it cycles and gives 1 +1/+1 counter in limited, maybe a little more but just not enough to be good",D+,U
Case of the Ransacked Lab,Good luck flipping this thing- looks fun in commander though!,G,U
Coveted Falcon,"It's funny, I don't think this will be super good and you ever want to give up more than like 1-2 permanents (I hope I'm very wrong)",D+,U
Cryptic Coat,"Can't be blocked is an insane keyword, this card is insane- you can just KEEP DOING IT for 5 mana???",A+,U
Forensic Gadgeteer,"1 mana to sac clues for a card is huge in the right deck, doesn't win games on its own but cool to build around  (build around B)",C+,U
Steamcore Scholar,"3 mana 2/2 flying, vig is already pretty good, staple some card draw/selection on it and you've got a very solid card.",B,U
Reenact the Crime,"Too situational, but I will be salty when I inevitably lose to this.",D-,U
Intrude on the Mind,"This is better Open the Fae Court, for some reason... still significantly better than that, but a little slower than I'd like",B-,U
Conspiracy Unraveler,"Too expensive to be super insane, but free spells are still crazy good. The problem is, what are you casting for free with this? Your topdecks?  (I want this to be insane so bad)",D,U
,,,
Case of the Stashed Skeleton,I love this so much. Either you get a 2 mana 2/1 menace/ can't block forever or your thing gets traded for and you get a Demonic Tutor on any future turn. I will play all of these.,A-,B
Homicide Investigator,"Bear with upside that's decent but not great. It's okay, I guess",C,B
Outrageous Robbery,"Fixed Villanous Wealth, I love it. It effectively reads ""you draw X cards from your opponent's deck and can play them whenever you want with mana of any color"". Not broken, but good.",B,B
Hunted Bonebrute,"I don't get this guy. Seems pretty mid, but there must be something I'm missing. I guess it will trade for 2 of your opponents creatures like every time (please prove me wrong)",C+,B
Illicit Masquerade,"Looks like fun, but requires a board presence to do anything so probably just too win-more to be good. ",D,B
Barbed Servitor,"Really cool upgraded Toski design, you can get extra cards or OP takes two of their creatures' powers in damage- not mega busted but seems good",B,B
"Massacre Girl, Known Killer",The definition of remove on sight. This girl is BUSTED.,A+,B
Deadly Cover-Up,"A SECOND unconditional wrath? It's five mana, but has more upside than the 4-mana one. It's still an A.",A,B
Vein Ripper,"Hard to cast, but insanely good and must be removed on sight at the cost of a creature, a removal spell, and 2 life drained. I love it, goes down a full tier because triple black",B-,B
,,,
Connecting the Dots,"A bit slow, but a decent value engine for the lategame if you're an attacking deck",C,R
Expedited Inheritance,This being symmetrical makes it so much worse,D-,R
Fugitive Codebreaker,"Both halves of this are pretty good, you staple them together and I like it- not likely to win the game by itself though",B-,R
Pyrotechnic Performer,I really like this guy- good by himself and crazy in a disguise-heavy deck,B,R
Case of the Crimson Pulse,I like this quite a bit in a red deck- card selection that becomes pure card draw if you play this in the late game/with no cards in hand and lets you draw 2 cards a turn pretty easily,B,R
"Krenko, Baron of Tin Street","3 mana 3/3 haste with upside- just very solid all around, insane in the artifact sac deck AND has some fun infinites in commander",B,R
Lamplight Phoenix,"3 mana 3/3 flying with recursion is quite good- the recursion isn't too bad to make happen, either",B+,R
Krenko's Buzzcrusher,"This reads ""2RR, 4/4 flying trample"". That is still a good statline",B,R
Anzrag's Rampage,Bad card is bad,G,R
Incinerator of the Guilty,"If this thing hits you, it's a Plague Wind. Busted busted busted busted. Remove on sight or die. 6 mana is a touch slow, though",A,R
,,,
Analyze the Pollen,"Tutors a land early or a creature late, not bad but not great",B-,G
Sharp-Eyed Rookie,"Bear that grows on you playing other creatures, makes clues to draw you more cards, AND has vig? I'm diggity down. Does not win the game by itself",B+,G
Archdruid's Charm,"Triple green hurts a ton, but the flexibility is nice",C+,G
Audience with Trostani,Awful awful awful awful. I am probably never playing this and WILL be sad when I open it in any draft/prerelease,G,G
Undergrowth Recon,"Unplayable in limited, interesting for commander",G,G
Hide in Plain Sight,"4 mana for 2 2/2 ward 2 creatures that you can flip at any time if you want? This is drawing 2 cards AND playing them with disguise for 2 mana each, yes please",A-,G
Axebane Ferox,"Looks about as rock solid as it gets, does not have reach though",B-,G
Case of the Locked Hothouse,"Unplayable in limited, interesting for commander",G,G
The Pride of Hull Clade,"This is my new sidequest, I love him and he doesn't actually seem that bad- if you can get this down to like 4-5 mana I'm super down for this (with some hopium included)",C+,G
,,,
Officious Interrogation,"Wierdly, I kinda like this. Gas if you have more creatures, a mana sink, and some value if your opponent has more creatures. Does not save you if you're behind at all, though.",C+,M
"Alquist Proft, Master Sleuth","Sphinx's Rev on a 3 mana 3/3 vig stick that also makes a clue? Seems pretty good to me, does need some building around to make the most of but just good on its own. (build around B+)",B,M
"Ezrim, Agency Chief","I want this to be a Bloodletter of Aclazotz-type card, but it just isn't quite that powerful. Four colored symbols hurts so bad. (please prove me wrong, I want this to be good)",B-,M
Drag the Canal,"A bear with flash and upside- seems good, but nothing overly insane",C+,M
"Lazav, Wearer of Faces","Overstatted, makes clues on attacks, and gives sac-ing clues more value- I like all of these things. Put it all together and it's quite solid.",B,M
"Etrata, Deadly Fugitive",Really gives OP some hard choices- either trade a creature off OR I get another creature every time it hits you. Also blocks well and has some nice value with cloaked spells.,B,M
Blood Spatter Analysis,Hard to cast Lightning Strike. Mid.,C-,M
"Judith, Carnage Connoisseur","In the right deck, this can be really strong as a value engine. Otherwise, it's a 5-mana 3/4 no text, which is just not good enough. (build around B)",C-,M
"Rakdos, Patron of Chaos","A bomb and a half. Must be removed on sight or you pretty much lose on the spot or next to it. 6 mana does hurt a little, though.",A,M
Worldsoul's Rage,"This usually deals X damage to any target, X is number of lands you have minus 2. Pretty deece",B-,M
"Yarus, Roar of the Gods","I love this guy. Solid stats, you play as many disguise cards as you can and either they hit OP and draw you a card OR they die and you flip them for free- both are great. Just okay without disguise creatures (build around A)",B,M
"Anzrag, the Quake-Mole","Fun, but a little win more and no keywords hurts quite a bit. Overstatted gets some points back, though",B-,M
"Trostani, Three Whispers","Hard to cast hurts it quite a bit, but a 3 mana 4/4 with flexible upside is quite powerful for 3 mana and giving deathtouch, vig, and double strike is all good, this could be better than I'm giving it credit for",B-,M
"Tolsimir, Midnight's Light","Good total stats, 2 bodies, good keywords, and decent upside is all nice- he is pretty hard to cast, though, which takes him down quite a bit",C+,M
Relive the Past,Stone unplayable. End of discussion.,G,M
"Teysa, Opulent Oligarch","Man, they did my girl dirty for commander. In limited, she's crazy good. A value engine for hitting your opponent and giving you 1/1 flyers for sac-ing clues even if you don't hit OP plus overstatted AND deathtouch. Love it.",A-,M
Treacherous Greed,"If you can ever cast this, it's probably good. Good luck casting it, though.",G,M
"Kaya, Spirits' Justice","Why did they pick this terrible character to be the planeswalker for this set? Sigh... Anyways, she protects herself with a +1, only costs 4, and is removal if you want it or a value engine. She's stupidly good.",A,M
Kylox's Voltstrider,"3 mana 4/4 crew 2 that can also give you free spells? I like it, not too crazy but free spells are good",B,M
Ill-Timed Explosion,"4 mana draw 2, optional wrath- very interesting, I kinda like it but it's nowhere close to the other wraths since it needs other cards",B-,M
"Kylox, Visionary Inventor","This is fun for commander, but 7 mana 4/4 menace, ward 2, haste is just good enough in limited. The other ability may as well not exist, I am not sac-ing a creature to MAYBE get a free spell that's like a 1 in 5.",D-,M
Assassin's Trophy,"This was standard playable 10 years ago. Emphasis on the 10 years ago. Gives your opponent way too much value in the early game, but hard to cast 2 mana hard removal for any permanent in the late game isn't the worst",D-,M
Urgent Necropsy,"In the right deck, this can approach Plague Wind levels of backbreaking. Otherwise, this needs a lot of help and usually is just 4 mana, instant, murder with extra requirements. Still pretty decent overall, though",B-,M
"Izoni, Center of the Web","IF you can collect evidence, I'm a slight fan. Lots of stats and menace and 2 reachers for 6 mana is pretty good, can also print more tokens on attacks. Nothing super bomby, though, so this is just fine.",B-,M
Warleader's Call,"This is impact tremors + an anthem for 3 mana. Not bad for an aggro deck or breaking boardstalls, does not win the game by itself though or help when you are on the back foot.",B-,M
"Agrus Kos, Spirit of Justice","I don't really get this guy, but I think he'll be pretty bomby. Might honestly be an A, I just don't get it yet",B+,M
"Aurelia, the Law Above","In the right deck, she will win the game by herself. Even on her own, 5 mana 4/4 flying, vig, haste is very strong- I am very interested in playing her",A-,M
Doppelgang,"Crackle with Power this is not. Just too slow for limited, will be cool in the right Commander deck.",G,M
"Kellan, Inquisitive Prodigy","The adventure is pretty mid, but 4 mana 3/4 flying vig with upside is rock solid. Staple the two on one card, and I like it, but not as much as LCI's Kellan",B-,M
"Vannifar, Evolved Enigma","I guess it turns extra cards into cloaked creatures? I don't get it, this feels like card disadvantage to get to cloak your big creatures or topdecks?? Someone's gonna have to convince me on this one",C,M
Leyline of the Guildpact,"Uh.... so this will be great in the 5 color good stuff deck, and exactly nowhere else. ",D,M
"Niv-Mizzet, Guildpact","Okay, this is an... okay reason to be 5 colors. I like him, he'll be a ton of fun in Commander, but in limited? I hope the 5 color deck works, if it does I am super down for this, otherwise like you just can't ever cast this. (build around B)",D-,M

Cryptex,"Too slow to be real ramp, this will probably play like a worse Treasure Map in LCI",D+,C
Commercial District,"All of these lands will probably play fine, but not great- they aren't man lands",C,L
